IncogNOTo
=========
A proof-of-concept Chrome extension by Matt Brenman
---------------------------------------------------

###Purpose:
Supporting material for an essay analyzing and discussing private browsing methods for my Computer System Security Class.

The privacy barrier that Incognito mode implies is easily broken if the user allows extensions to run in Incognito mode. This extension provides an easy way to demonstrate this concept by gathering hostnames of sites visited (whether or not Incognito mode is active). 

###Use:
Clicking on the extension icon pulls up the list of hosts and their corresponding visit counts

###Installation
To install, download the folder containing all of the files. In Google Chrome, go to chome://extensions/ and click, "Load unpacked extension..." After loading, click "Allow in incognito" and click Reload. The extension icon (lock.png) should appear in the extension bar, and the extension should be active.
